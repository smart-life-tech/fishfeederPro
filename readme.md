### Hardware Setup:
Provide instructions on how to set up the hardware components required for the project.

```markdown
## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the servo motor to pin `SERVO_PIN` on the ESP32.
2. Connect the relay to pin `RELAY_PIN` on the ESP32.
3. Connect buttons for increment, decrement, and set actions to pins `INC_BUTTON_PIN`, `DEC_BUTTON_PIN`, and `SET_BUTTON_PIN` respectively.
4. Optionally, connect an LCD screen to the ESP32 for display.
5. Power the ESP32 microcontroller.
```

### Software Setup:
Explain how to set up the software environment and dependencies.

```markdown
## Software Setup

1. Install the required libraries (`BluetoothSerial`, `RTClib`, `Servo`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`) in your Arduino IDE.
2. Download and open the `ESP32_Fish_Feeder_Controller.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the sketch to your ESP32 board.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to view debug messages and status updates.
5. Install a Bluetooth terminal application on your smartphone or computer to communicate with the ESP32 via Bluetooth.
